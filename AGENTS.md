# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)

- **Session gate**: before responding to ANY user message, run `compose-agentsmd` from the project root. AGENTS.md contains the rules you operate under; stale rules cause rule violations. If you discover you skipped this step mid-session, stop, run it immediately, re-read the diff, and adjust your behavior before continuing.
- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, install it via npm: `npm install -g compose-agentsmd`.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes the rules workspace when `source` is GitHub (if the workspace is clean), then regenerates `AGENTS.md` with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

## Course site metadata / sidebar rules

- Define a page title in frontmatter (`title`); do not override titles in `_meta.ts`.
- For grouping-only folders (no `index.mdx`), set the display label in `_meta.ts`.
- Control default sidebar collapse behavior via `theme.config.tsx` sidebar settings (`defaultMenuCollapseLevel`, `autoCollapse`).
  - Use `theme.collapsed` only when an exception is truly necessary.

## Course site content authoring (pages / exercises / exams)

This module defines stable, cross-course rules for authoring course content.
Write these rules in a way that keeps learning outcomes (clarity, sequencing, reproducibility) as the top priority.

### Decision priority

- Prefer learning effectiveness over convenience or brevity.

## Page content and samples

- Write learner-facing text (body, labels, output strings) in Japanese using beginner-friendly vocabulary.
- Keep prose non-verbose; split longer explanations into short paragraphs, bullet lists, and small headings.
- Do not include editor notes, meta commentary, or policy statements in learner-facing content.
- Keep terminology, heading structure, and explanation granularity consistent with existing pages.
- Keep samples focused: one sample = one topic; split when a sample becomes long.
- Use intention-revealing identifiers; avoid 1-letter variables except `i`/`j`.
- For code that produces output, include expected output inline (e.g. `console.log(x); // 出力: ...`).
- Write comments inside sample code in Japanese.
- Add language info to fenced code blocks (`js`, `ts`, `html`, `css`).
- At the start of a chapter, add 1–2 sentences explaining where/why the topic is used.
- When referencing real websites, do not link to pages that show personal data or require authentication.

## Prerequisites (learned vs. not yet learned)

- Use the order in `content/**/_meta.ts` as the source of truth for what is already learned.
- If a page/exercise would require an unlearned API or syntax, add prerequisite explanation first or redesign the task.

## Directories and adding pages (Nextra standard)

- The standard framework is Nextra (Next.js + MDX); do not introduce Docusaurus for new course sites.
- Key paths:
  - `content/` (docs), `content/**/_meta.ts` (ordering), `theme.config.tsx` / `src/app/` (routing/layout), `public/` (static).
- Create new pages as “folder pages”:
  - `content/docs/<chapter>/<slug>/index.mdx` (use `index.md` only if no components are needed).
  - Include frontmatter `title` at the top.
  - Place required imports immediately after frontmatter (MDX).
- When adding/splitting pages, update the sibling `_meta.ts` so ordering matches prerequisites (append to the end when unsure).

## Exam content layout (`content/exams`)

- Split by year: `content/exams/<year>/...` where `<year>` is numeric (e.g. `2026`).
- Use the fixed order: term → exam → kind:
  - `content/exams/<year>/<term>/<exam>/<kind>/index.mdx`
- Do not create pages for grouping-only folders (no `index.mdx`); set their display name in `_meta.ts`.
- Slug conventions:
  - First semester: `1semester`
  - Second semester: `2semester`
  - Midterm: `1midterm-exam`
  - Final: `2final-exam`
  - Overview: `overview`
  - Preparation: `preparation`

## Preparation questions / quizzes (source of truth = plain Markdown)

- Store the *source of truth* as plain Markdown that conforms to `markdown-to-qti/docs/markdown-question-spec.md`.
  - 1 question = 1 file.
  - No frontmatter.
  - Keep the required heading structure (`#`, `## Type`, `## Prompt`, ...).
- Mark question-spec sources explicitly by filename:
  - Use the `.qspec.md` extension (e.g. `q1.qspec.md`).
  - Directory placement is arbitrary; transformation is keyed by the extension.
- In display pages (`index.mdx`), import and render each question (e.g. `import Q1 from './q1.qspec.md'` then `<Q1 />`).
- Course Docs Site renders question-spec Markdown via `@metyatech/course-docs-platform`:
  - `Type: cloze` converts `{{answer}}` to `${answer}` and enables blanks (including inside code blocks).
  - Inside `## Prompt`, `### Exam` is treated as a presentation convention (rendered as a tip callout titled `本試験では`).
  - `## Scoring` is rendered as a note callout titled `採点基準・配点`.
  - `## Explanation` is rendered inside `<Solution>`.
  - Details: `course-docs-platform/docs/markdown-question-spec-course-docs-rendering.md`.

## Admonitions in course pages

- For admonitions in course pages, use only `tip`, `note`, `warning`, `caution`, `important`.
- Unsupported admonition types are authoring errors; fix the source instead of relying on fallback rendering.

## Page assets (images / downloads)

- Keep page assets page-scoped (no shared asset directory).
- Images live in `content/**/<slug>/img/...`:
  - Inline Markdown images: `![...](./img/example.png)`
  - When an image must be loaded in MDX code: `import exampleUrl from './img/example.png'`
- Downloadable files live in `content/**/<slug>/assets/...`:
  - `import fileUrl from './assets/<name>';`
  - Use `<a href={fileUrl} download="<name>">...</a>` (always set `download` to avoid hashed filenames).
  - Treat imports as URL strings (do not use `.default`).
- When the same asset is needed in multiple pages, copy it into each page’s `img/` or `assets/` directory (do not create inter-page dependencies).

## Asset build assumptions (Nextra / Next.js)

- The site assumes `@metyatech/course-docs-platform` webpack rules (`applyCourseAssetWebpackRules`) are enabled so `content/**/img` and `content/**/assets` can be imported as URLs.
- If you add an asset and the build fails with loader errors, first check that `next.config.js` uses `@metyatech/course-docs-platform/next`.

## CodePreview (`@metyatech/code-preview`)

- Prefer CodePreview for runnable samples; use normal code blocks for static syntax explanations.
- Do not import `@metyatech/code-preview/styles.css` in pages (styles are injected by the component).
- Put the initial code inside `<CodePreview>...</CodePreview>` as fenced blocks.
  - Use `html` / `css` / `js` / `javascript` language labels (do not omit).
  - HTML blocks contain only `<body>` content (no `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
  - Keep CSS and JS in separate blocks; do not inline `<style>` / `<script>` into HTML.
  - CSS formatting: braces on their own lines; `property: value;` with a space after `:`.
- For images referenced from CodePreview, use the `images` map (virtual path → imported URL).
  - Use virtual paths like `img/...` for consistency with page-local images.
- Use `sourceId` to share the same source across multiple previews (unique within the page).
- Panel visibility is controlled via `htmlVisible`, `cssVisible`, `jsVisible`, `previewVisible`.
- For “final demo” previews, show only the preview panel by default.
- For learner-implemented previews, disable sharing (`share={false}`).

## Exercises (`@metyatech/exercise`)

- Use `<Exercise>` and `<Solution>` from `@metyatech/exercise/client`.
  - Place `<Solution>` at the end of the same `<Exercise>`.
- Numbering:
  - Use `演習N` / `演習-発展N` (N starts at 1) and keep numbering unique within the page.
- Problem statements must be unambiguous:
  - Provide starting data, steps, how to verify, and a clear target behavior/appearance.
  - Hints are allowed, but do not include “direct answers” (put those in `<Solution>`).
- For styling/visual exercises, show the expected final appearance (preview, image, or equivalent).
- Avoid “essentially the same” exercises:
  - Check already-covered exercises on the page and earlier pages.
  - Prefer different angles (state, multiple events, conditions, accumulation, linked elements, etc.).

## Assessments (exam questions written in Markdown)

- Write questions so there is a single interpretation and a single correct answer.
- Avoid ambiguous verbs like “switch”; specify the exact state transition.
- For UI behavior questions, include a visual target (GIF/image) when feasible.
- For fill-in-the-blank questions, specify the expected answer format and any forbidden answers.
- For external-system blanks, use `${answer}` (multiple answers: `${/regex/}`); do not convert to custom placeholders (e.g. `【1】`).
- If multiple answers are allowed, describe the allowed range explicitly (e.g. `textContent` or `innerText`).

## Course docs repository architecture (DRY)

This document describes the canonical repository split for metyatech course documentation sites.
The goal is to keep the system DRY and minimize duplicated “site runtime” code across courses.

### Repositories and responsibilities

- `metyatech/course-docs-site`
  - The **only** runnable site app (Next.js + Nextra).
  - Syncs `content/` and `site.config.ts` from a course content repository at dev/build time.
  - Owns routing, layouts, middleware, and end-to-end tests for the site runtime.
- `metyatech/course-docs-platform`
  - Shared, reusable building blocks consumed by `course-docs-site`.
  - Owns MDX components, remark/rehype config, webpack asset rules, and shared site features.
- `<course>-course-docs` (e.g. `metyatech/javascript-course-docs`, `metyatech/programming-course-docs`)
  - **Content-only** repositories (no Next.js app code).
  - Owns only course content and course-specific configuration.
- `metyatech/programming-course-student-works` (student submissions, large binaries)
  - Student works hosting repository (GitHub Pages).
  - Generates and publishes `works-index.json` for the course site to render the works list.

### Shared runtime boundary rules

- Treat `course-docs-platform` as the source of truth for reusable runtime behavior.
  - Put shared MDX components, shared UI behavior, and shared rendering/runtime integrations in `course-docs-platform`.
- Keep `course-docs-site` as composition/wiring only.
  - Do not add direct imports of shared runtime packages in `course-docs-site` when the behavior belongs in `course-docs-platform`.
- When deciding where to implement a fix, use impact scope first.
  - If the change should apply to multiple courses or any future course site, implement it in `course-docs-platform`.
  - Use `course-docs-site` only for app-shell concerns (routing, layout wiring, middleware, local runtime orchestration, E2E wiring).
- Do not ship temporary site-local duplication of platform behavior.
  - If an urgent site-local patch is unavoidable, migrate it into `course-docs-platform` in the same change set before completion.
- Keep shared dependency ownership aligned with architecture.
  - Dependencies required by platform-owned runtime behavior must be declared in `course-docs-platform`, then consumed via platform exports/APIs from `course-docs-site`.

### Content repository rules (course docs repos)

- Must be content-only:
  - Keep only `content/**`, `public/img/**` (static site assets), and `site.config.ts`.
  - Do not add Next.js/Nextra app runtime files (`next.config.js`, `src/app`, `package.json`, etc.).
- `public/img/favicon.ico` is expected by `site.config.ts` (`faviconHref`).
  - Do not keep framework boilerplate assets (e.g. Docusaurus logos) unless referenced by content.
- Do not store secrets in a content repo:
  - `.env.local` is local-only and belongs in `course-docs-site` (and is gitignored).

### Local development and switching courses

- Always preview locally via `metyatech/course-docs-site` (never by adding app code to a content repo).
- Prefer a local directory for course content while editing:
  - Set `COURSE_CONTENT_SOURCE=../javascript-course-docs` (or `../programming-course-docs`) in `course-docs-site/.env.course.local`.
  - Run `npm run dev` (or `npm run build`) in `course-docs-site`.
- Switching `COURSE_CONTENT_SOURCE` is a supported workflow:
  - The dev launcher restarts on env change and keeps the originally chosen port.
  - `scripts/sync-course-content.mjs` clears `.next` automatically when the course source changes to prevent stale Next.js artifacts.
  - Do not rely on manual “delete `.next`” instructions; treat stale artifacts as a runtime defect and fix the runtime.

### Student works hosting rules

- Do not store `student-works` binaries in a course content repo.
- Prefer a dedicated GitHub Pages repository for works hosting.
- Publish a machine-readable index for the site runtime:
  - `works-index.json` at `<NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKS_BASE_URL>/works-index.json`.
  - The site reads this index server-side to render the works list.

### Deployment rules (Vercel)

- Do **not** use Vercel’s GitHub integration for course sites.
- Deploy via GitHub Actions using the Vercel CLI:
  - Secrets: `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`.
  - The workflow should checkout `metyatech/course-docs-site` and build/deploy it.

### Specs vs. site rendering conventions

- Keep generic, tool-agnostic specs in their dedicated repositories.
  - Example: the plain Markdown question format lives in `markdown-to-qti` (`docs/markdown-question-spec.md`).
- Do **not** add Course Docs Site-specific presentation concepts (e.g. `### Exam`) to generic specs.
  - Document such items as **site rendering conventions** in `course-docs-platform` (and reference them from the course authoring rules).
